# TES-2025: Event-Driven Gate Scheduling Specification

## 6. Event-Driven Development Scheduling

### 6.1 Core Principles

TES-2025 scheduling operates on **event-driven gates** rather than human time metrics. Development progress is measured by **task completion events** and **quality gate validations**, not calendar time or monetary estimates.

**Scheduling Philosophy:**
- Tasks are granular units of work with explicit predecessors and successors
- Gates represent quality checkpoints requiring human-in-the-loop (HITL) validation
- Either/or conditions allow flexible branching based on runtime decisions
- No time-based estimates or dollar value projections

### 6.2 Task Definition Format

Each task follows this specification:

```
TASK-ID: Descriptive Name
Type: [Implementation|Integration|Testing|Documentation|Analysis]
Predecessors: [TASK-ID1, TASK-ID2] | [Either: TASK-ID1 or TASK-ID2]
Successors: [TASK-ID3, TASK-ID4]
Deliverables: [KO-refs, artifacts, test results]
Validation: [Automated checks, human review requirements]
```

### 6.3 Gate Definition Format

Gates represent quality checkpoints:

```
GATE-ID: Purpose Description
Trigger: [Task completion events]
Validation Requirements:
  - Automated: [Test harness, build verification, static analysis]
  - Human: [HITL review, legal IP assessment]
Actions:
  - POE Report: Generate and submit to HITL
  - IP Review: Check infringement + patentability assessment
  - FTO Analysis: Freedom to Operate evaluation
  - Approval: Human gate closure decision
  - Post-Gate: [Project analysis, repo cleanup, git commit, release build]
```

### 6.4 Development Sections

### 6.5 Gate Closure Protocol

#### Automated Validation
1. **Test Harness Execution**: Full test suite with coverage analysis
2. **Build Verification**: Clean build across all target platforms
3. **Static Analysis**: Security scanning, dependency auditing, code quality checks
4. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end workflow validation

#### Human Validation (HITL)
1. **POE Review**: Proof of Execution artifacts assessment
2. **IP Analysis**:
   - **Infringement Check**: Scan for potential conflicts with existing patents
   - **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop workarounds for identified risks
   - **FTO Assessment**: Evaluate freedom to operate constraints
   - **Patentability Review**: Identify novel implementations for IP protection
3. **Quality Assessment**: Code review, architecture evaluation, documentation completeness

#### Post-Gate Actions
1. **Project Analysis**: Automated code quality and complexity assessment
2. **Repository Cleanup**: Remove temporary files, update dependencies, format code
3. **Git Operations**: Commit changes with descriptive messages, tag releases
4. **Release Build**: Generate production artifacts if gate represents release milestone
5. **CI/CD Compliance**: Ensure all automated checks pass and artifacts are properly stored

### 6.6 Event-Driven Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked through **task completion events** and **gate closure events**:

- **Task Events**: `TASK-ID.completed`, `TASK-ID.failed`, `TASK-ID.blocked`
- **Gate Events**: `GATE-ID.opened`, `GATE-ID.validated`, `GATE-ID.closed`
- **Quality Events**: `QUALITY.security.passed`, `QUALITY.perf.met`, `QUALITY.ip.cleared`

### 6.7 Flexible Branching

Either/or conditions allow adaptive development:

```
TASK-X1: Primary Implementation
Predecessors: [TASK-W1]
Either/Or: TASK-X2 (if experimental) or TASK-X3 (if stable)
Successors: [GATE-X-VALIDATION]
```

This enables:
- **Experimental branches** for high-risk features
- **Stable paths** for production-ready implementations
- **Conditional dependencies** based on runtime decisions

### 6.8 Success Metrics

Success is measured by:
- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks reaching completion events
- **Gate Closure Time**: Time from gate opening to human approval
- **Quality Metrics**: Automated test pass rates, security scan results
- **IP Health**: Number of identified patentable inventions, FTO risk assessment
- **Process Efficiency**: Reduction in human review cycles, automated validation coverage
